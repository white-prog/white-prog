- 👋 Hi, I’m @white-prog
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, problem-solving, independent research and exploring multiple scientific disciplines like math, biology, chemistry and physics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning by doing hands-on projects like data structure and algorithm in c, applying python to real world and a shell project etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, bug bounty challenges, and science-based programs.
- 📫 How to reach me: Here for now!
- 😄 Pronouns: I don't care
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy training my brain in multiple dimensions and learning through self-designed projects.
